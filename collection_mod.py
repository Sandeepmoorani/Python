# Python Collection Module
# The Python collection module is defined as a container that is used to store collections of data, for example - list, dict, set, and tuple, etc. It was introduced to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers.

# Python collection module was first introduced in its 2.4 release.

# There are different types of collection modules which are as follows:

# namedtuple()
# The Python namedtuple() function returns a tuple-like object with names for each position in the tuple. It was used to eliminate the problem of remembering the index of each field of a tuple object in ordinary tuples.



# Examples:

pranshu = ('James', 24, 'M')    
print(pranshu)
