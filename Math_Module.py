# What is Math Module in Python?
# Python has a built-in math module. It is a standard module, so we don't need to install it separately. We only have to import it into the program we want to use. We can import the module, like any other module of Python, using import math to implement the functions to perform mathematical operations.

# Since the source code of this module is in the C language, it provides access to the functionalities of the underlying C library. 


# This program will show the calculation of square root using the math module  
# importing the math module  
import math  
print(math.sqrt( 9 ))  


# **************************************************************

# Constants in Math Module
# The value of numerous constants, including pi and tau, is provided in the math module so that we do not have to remember them. Using these constants eliminates the need to precisely and repeatedly write down the value of each constant. The math module includes the following constants:

# Euler's Number
# Tau
# Infinity
# Pi
# Not a Number (NaN)
# Let's go over each of them one by one.
