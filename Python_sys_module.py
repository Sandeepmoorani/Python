# Python sys module
# The python sys module provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Environment. It lets us access system-specific parameters and functions.


# import sys

# First, we have to import the sys module in our program before running any functions.

# sys.modules
# his function provides the name of the existing python modules which have been imported.

# sys.argv

# This function returns a list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. The name of the script is always the item at index 0, and the rest of the arguments are stored at subsequent indices.

# sys.base_exec_prefix

# This function provides an efficient way to the same value as exec_prefix. If not running a virtual environment, the value will remain the same.
