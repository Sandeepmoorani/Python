# Python abs() Function

# The python abs() function is used to return the absolute value of a number. It takes only one argument, a number whose absolute value is to be returned. The argument can be an integer and floating-point number. If the argument is a complex number, then, abs() returns its magnitude.



#  integer number     
integer = -20  
print('Absolute value of -40 is:', abs(integer))  
  
#  floating number  
floating = -20.83  
print('Absolute value of -40.83 is:', abs(floating))
