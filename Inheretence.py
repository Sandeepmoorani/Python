# Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.

# In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.


# Syntax

# class derived-class(base class):  
#     <class-suite>


class Animal:  
    def speak(self):  
        print("Animal Speaking")  
#child class Dog inherits the base class Animal  
class Dog(Animal):  
    def bark(self):  
        print("dog barking")  
d = Dog()  
d.bark()  
d.speak()  



# Multi Level Inheretence 

class Animal:  
    def speak(self):  
        print("Animal Speaking")  
#The child class Dog inherits the base class Animal  
class Dog(Animal):  
    def bark(self):  
        print("dog barking")  
#The child class Dogchild inherits another child class Dog  
class DogChild(Dog):  
    def eat(self):  
        print("Eating bread...")  
d = DogChild()  
d.bark()  
d.speak()  
d.eat()  




# Multiple inheretence 

class Calculation1:  
    def Summation(self,a,b):  
        return a+b;  
class Calculation2:  
    def Multiplication(self,a,b):  
        return a*b;  
class Derived(Calculation1,Calculation2):  
    def Divide(self,a,b):  
        return a/b;  
d = Derived()  
print(d.Summation(10,20))  
print(d.Multiplication(10,20))  
print(d.Divide(10,20))  





# The issubclass(sub,sup) method

# The issubclass(sub, sup) method is used to check the relationships between the specified classes. It returns true if the first class is the subclass of the second class, and false otherwise.

class Calculation1:  
    def Summation(self,a,b):  
        return a+b;  
class Calculation2:  
    def Multiplication(self,a,b):  
        return a*b;  
class Derived(Calculation1,Calculation2):  
    def Divide(self,a,b):  
        return a/b;  
d = Derived()  
print(issubclass(Derived,Calculation2))  
print(issubclass(Calculation1,Calculation2))  




# The isinstance (obj, class) method


# The isinstance() method is used to check the relationship between the objects and classes. It returns true if the first parameter, i.e., obj is the instance of the second parameter, i.e., class.

class Calculation1:  
    def Summation(self,a,b):  
        return a+b;  
class Calculation2:  
    def Multiplication(self,a,b):  
        return a*b;  
class Derived(Calculation1,Calculation2):  
    def Divide(self,a,b):  
        return a/b;  
d = Derived()  
print(isinstance(d,Derived))  



# *******************************************

# Method Overriding


# We can provide some specific implementation of the parent class method in our child class. When the parent class method is defined in the child class with some specific implementation, then the concept is called method overriding. We may need to perform method overriding in the scenario where the different definition of a parent class method is needed in the child class.

# Consider the following example to perform method overriding in python.


class Animal:  
    def speak(self):  
        print("speaking")  
class Dog(Animal):  
    def speak(self):  
        print("Barking")  
d = Dog()  
d.speak


# Real Life Example of method overriding


class Bank:  
    def getroi(self):  
        return 10;  
class SBI(Bank):  
    def getroi(self):  
        return 7;  
  
class ICICI(Bank):  
    def getroi(self):  
        return 8;  
b1 = Bank()  
b2 = SBI()  
b3 = ICICI()  
print("Bank Rate of interest:",b1.getroi());  
print("SBI Rate of interest:",b2.getroi());  
print("ICICI Rate of interest:",b3.getroi());
